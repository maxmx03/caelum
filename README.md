## Why use Caelum ü§î

When it comes to Vim colorschemes, there are a lot of options out there. However, many of them are outdated or lack support for the latest version of Vim. 
That's where Caelum comes in.

But Caelum isn't just about looks. We've put a lot of effort into making sure that the syntax highlighting is optimized for readability and ease of use. 
Whether you're coding late into the night or just spending a lot of time in Vim, Caelum is easy on the eyes and won't leave you feeling fatigued.
